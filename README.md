xmerlsec
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evax/xmerlsec.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evax/xmerlsec)

A NIF around [xmlsec](http://aleksey.com/xmlsec/) to handle XML signatures
in Erlang.


This fork is for development purposes only at the moment. The lib paths and cflags are being extracted from a homebrew installed version of xmlsec.

It is not recommended for production use as on some linux systems xmlsec1 is actually xmlsec (and vice versa).
